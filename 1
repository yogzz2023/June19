Functional requirements  for SRS

My content is first we have authentication then file transfer then encryption and decryption of files and if we get a emergency signal then emergency erasure

Based on your description, here are the functional requirements for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) of your system:

Authentication:

The system should provide a secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users accessing the system.

Users should be required to provide valid credentials, such as username and password, to authenticate themselves.

The system should enforce appropriate security measures, such as password complexity requirements and account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts.

File Transfer:

The system should allow users to upload and download files securely.

Users should be able to select files from their local devices and transfer them to the system.

The system should provide a reliable and efficient mechanism for transferring files, ensuring data integrity during the process.

Encryption and Decryption of Files:

The system should support encryption and decryption of files to ensure their confidentiality.

Users should have the option to encrypt files before uploading them to the system.

Upon download, encrypted files should be automatically decrypted for authorized users.

Emergency Signal:

The system should be capable of receiving and interpreting an emergency signal or trigger.

When an emergency signal is received, the system should initiate the emergency erasure process.


The emergency erasure process should securely delete sensitive data stored in the system to prevent unauthorized access.


It's important to note that these requirements provide a high-level overview. To create a comprehensive SRS, you should consider additional details, such as specific user roles, system constraints, performance requirements, error handling, and any other relevant functional and non-functional aspects.

Functional requirements  for SRS

My content is first we have authentication then file transfer then encryption and decryption of files and if we get a emergency signal then emergency erasure 

ChatGPT

Based on your description, here are the functional requirements for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) of your system:

Authentication:

The system should provide a secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users accessing the system.

Users should be required to provide valid credentials, such as username and password, to authenticate themselves.

The system should enforce appropriate security measures, such as password complexity requirements and account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts.

File Transfer:

The system should allow users to upload and download files securely.

Users should be able to select files from their local devices and transfer them to the system.

The system should provide a reliable and efficient mechanism for transferring files, ensuring data integrity during the process.

Encryption and Decryption of Files:

The system should support encryption and decryption of files to ensure their confidentiality.

Users should have the option to encrypt files before uploading them to the system.

Upon download, encrypted files should be automatically decrypted for authorized users.

Emergency Signal:

The system should be capable of receiving and interpreting an emergency signal or trigger.

When an emergency signal is received, the system should initiate the emergency erasure process.

The emergency erasure process should securely delete sensitive data stored in the system to prevent unauthorized access.

It's important to note that these requirements provide a high-level overview. To create a comprehensive SRS, you should consider additional details, such as specific user roles, system constraints, performance requirements, error handling, and any other relevant functional and non-functional aspects.

Give  with introduction,input, processing,output for each cases

ChatGPT

Sure! Here's an expanded version of the functional requirements, including an introduction, input, processing, and output for each case:

Authentication:

Introduction:

The authentication feature ensures that only authorized users can access the system by verifying their identity through valid credentials.

Input:

User's username and password.

Processing:

The system checks the provided username and password against stored credentials.

It validates the credentials and determines if the user is authorized to access the system.

The system may employ encryption or hashing techniques to secure the stored passwords.

Output:

Successful authentication: The user is granted access to the system.

Failed authentication: The user is denied access and receives an appropriate error message.

Security measures: The system enforces password complexity rules and may lock user accounts after multiple failed login attempts.

File Transfer:

Introduction:

The file transfer feature allows users to securely upload and download files to and from the system.

Input:

User-selected files for upload or download.

Processing:

The system validates the file format, size, and permissions.

For file uploads, the system stores the files securely in a designated location.

For file downloads, the system retrieves the requested file securely.

Output:

Successful file upload: The system confirms that the file has been uploaded and stored securely.

Successful file download: The requested file is downloaded securely to the user's device.

Failed file transfer: The system provides appropriate error messages if the upload or download process encounters issues.

Encryption and Decryption of Files:

Introduction:

The encryption and decryption feature ensures the confidentiality of files stored in the system by allowing users to encrypt and decrypt their files.

Input:

User-selected files for encryption or decryption.

Processing:

When encrypting files, the system applies a secure encryption algorithm to the selected files.

When decrypting files, the system applies the corresponding decryption algorithm to restore the original content.

Output:

Encrypted file: The system provides the user with the encrypted version of the file.

Decrypted file: The system presents the user with the decrypted file, allowing them to access the original content.

Error messages: The system notifies the user if any issues occur during the encryption or decryption process.

Emergency Signal:

Introduction:

The emergency signal feature allows the system to respond to an emergency situation by initiating an emergency erasure process to secure sensitive data.

Input:

Emergency signal or trigger.

Processing:

Upon receiving the emergency signal, the system triggers the emergency erasure process.

The emergency erasure process securely deletes sensitive data stored in the system, ensuring it cannot be recovered.

Output:

Erasure confirmation: The system provides confirmation that the emergency erasure process has been successfully executed.

System status: The system may enter a secure state or display a notification indicating the erasure process completion.

Log or audit: The system may log relevant information regarding the emergency signal and erasure process for future reference.

the corresponding decryption algorithm to restore the original content.

       - It verifies the integrity and authenticity of the encrypted file before decryption.

       - The system may decompress the file after decryption, if compression was applied during encryption.

   - Output:

     - Encrypted file:

       - The system provides the user with the encrypted version of the file.

       - It may prompt the user to save the encrypted file locally or provide a download link.

     - Decrypted file:

       - The system presents the user with the decrypted file, allowing them to access the original content.

       - It ensures the integrity of the decrypted file by verifying its checksum or signature.

       - The system may provide options to save or download the decrypted file.

     - Error messages:

       - The system notifies the user if any issues occur during the encryption or decryption process, such as an incorrect encryption key or corrupted file.

       - It may suggest alternative actions or provide guidance on resolving the error.

4. Emergency Signal:

   - Introduction:

     - The emergency signal feature allows the system to respond to an emergency situation by initiating an emergency erasure process to secure sensitive data.

     - It ensures that critical data is promptly and securely erased in emergency scenarios to prevent unauthorized access.

   - Input:

     - Emergency signal or trigger.

   - Processing:

     - Upon receiving the emergency signal, the system triggers the emergency erasure process.

     - The system identifies and locates sensitive data, such as user credentials, personal information, or confidential files.

     - It employs secure deletion algorithms to overwrite the sensitive data, making it unrecoverable.

     - The system may follow industry best practices for data erasure, such as multiple passes or cryptographic deletion techniques.

     - It updates relevant metadata or database records to indicate the erasure status and prevent data restoration.

   - Output:

     - Erasure confirmation:

       - The system provides confirmation that the emergency erasure process has been successfully executed.

       - It may display a success message or log the erasure event for auditing purposes.

     - System status:

       - The system may enter a secure state, limiting access to critical functions or entering a restricted mode during the emergency scenario.

       - It may display a notification or warning to users about the emergency erasure and its impact on system operations.

     - Log or audit:

       - The system may log relevant information regarding the emergency signal and erasure process for future reference and compliance purposes.

       - It may record details such as the timestamp, triggering event, actions performed, and affected data.

These additional details provide a more comprehensive understanding of the input, processing, and output for each functional requirement. Remember to tailor these details to your specific system and its requirements.


These descriptions provide a general understanding of the input, processing, and output for each functional requirement. However, it's important to consider additional details and potential variations based on your specific system and implementation requirements.
